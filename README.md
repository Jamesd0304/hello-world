# hello-world
first attempt at creating a git repository 
 My names is James, I have been teaching myself to code and program for several years. I recently made the decision to finish my degree in computer science. I really would like to meet someone who can help me develope my skills and gain real working experience. I would like to eventually be able to help people learn to code and apply the skills to the real world needs.
 Lets see if this change is made.
